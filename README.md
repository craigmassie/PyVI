# PyVI

<b>PyVi was a prototype developed as part of the Annual Microsoft Hack.</b> As opposed to working on 1 large project, our team split into 3 divisions: Code difference, Code navigation and Code structure. PyVi was our attempt at eliviating some difficulties facing the visually impaired when discerning code structure. The project was awarded Runner Up at Microsoft Research Cambridge.

The goal of PyVi was to create a tool which allows visually impaired users to quickly, and effectively navigate large code bases. Current tools are frustrating, and require the user to navigate line by line with a screen reader to generate an understanding of a program's functionality. This approach would cost a lot of time, and would require the user to memorise vast figures of line numbers. PyVi splits the code base into different sections (k-ary tree), which the end user can traverse to gain further insight to a specific function or code block, saving the user time and effort.

PyVi was designed with accessibility in mind, and will work with your favourite screen reader.
